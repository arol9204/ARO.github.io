                    <h3>Project Details</h3>
                    <p>As a non-native English speaker who migrated to Canada, I've been on a mission to improve my English skills. I was motivated to enhance my English speaking skills, but the high costs of language courses discouraged me. That's when I got the idea to create an app that could help me improve without financial constraints.</p>

                    <h4>What it does</h4>
                    <p>This application aims to provide a comprehensive language learning experience, focusing specifically on improving English speaking skills for test takers, such as those preparing for the IELTS/CELPIP exam.
                        The application utilizes the Whisper model to transcribe the user's spoken responses. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, the application leverages a Language Learning Model (LLM) as well.
                         The LLM takes both the transcribed text and the corresponding question as input. By considering the context of the question and the user's response, the LLM generates an assessment of the given answer.
                          This assessment includes analyzing grammar, vocabulary usage, coherence, and fluency, among other language aspects.</p>
                    <h4>How I built it</h4>
                    <p>I started developing the project using Google Colab, I integrated the "Whisper" model from OpenAI with a Language Learning Model (LLM) to provide feedback on English language usage.
                         It was an exciting journey as I combined these technologies to create a useful tool for language learners.</p>
