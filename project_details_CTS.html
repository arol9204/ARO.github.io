                    <h3>Project Details</h3>
                    <p>The automotive industry is going through a paradigm shift from conventional, human-driven vehicles into Autonomous,Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered vehicles. AVs offer a safe, efficient, and cost-effective solution that will dramaticallyredefine the future of human mobility. AVs are expected to save over half a million lives and generate enormous economicopportunities in excess of $1 trillion dollars by 2035. From GM’s Cruise and Google’s autonomous car (Waymo) to Uber’sself-driving car-sharing service, the automotive industry is on a billion-dollar quest to deploy the most technologicallyadvanced vehicles on the road.</p>
                    <p>In this challenge, you are tasked to train and evaluate several deep CNNs to classify traffic sign images. 
                        The dataset contains colored 32 x 32 pixels images with 43 different traffic sign classes. 
                        Images are divided into 34799 images for training, 12630 for testing and 4410 for validation. 
                        </p>

                        <h4> Challenge Deliverables: </h4>
                            <li>Research AlexNet Convolutional Neural Network, draw the network architecture, and indicate the use of each of the layers such as convolution/feature extraction, max pooling, and flattening layers. </li>
                            <li>Visualize a sample image from each class in the dataset. Display the corresponding label and perform a sanity check. </li>
                            <li>Train a CNN based on AlexNet to classify traffic signs. Train the model using 15 epochs and plot the network accuracy vs. the number of epochs. </li>
                            <li>Test the trained CNN and evaluate its performance on the testing (holdout) dataset. Note that the testing dataset has never been seen by the model during training.</li>
                            <li>Fine-tune the trained model by training it on additional datasets. Feel free to collect data from the internet or using a mobile device.</li>
                            <li>Explore 3 different ways to improve the network accuracy such as increasing the number of epochs, adding additional convolutional/max-pooling layers, or adding dropout layers. Retrain the network and display the results. Any reasonable answer should be sufficient.</li>
                            <li>Build 3 different deep convolutional neural networks with various architectures. Feel free to choose the number of layers, number of kernels (feature detectors), number of dense (Fully-connected) layers, number of neurons in the dense layer, activation functions, regularization such as dropout..etc. Retrain the network and plot the results.</li>
                            <li>Test the trained deep CNNs on brand-new images. This might involve collecting traffic sign data and evaluating the system's performance and make adjustment as necessary.</li>
